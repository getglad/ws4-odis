"""In-sandbox agent for the OpenShell-gated demo.

Runs INSIDE an OpenShell sandbox whose network policy permits exactly one destination:
the ODIS Router's MCP endpoint. Everything else — including the vendor MCP server — is
default-denied by the sandbox supervisor's egress proxy.

It demonstrates the enforced wedge end to end:
  1. A *direct* connection to the vendor is BLOCKED (the agent has no path to it).
  2. Driving the Router: an allowed tool call is gated + forwarded; a denied one is refused.

The agent never holds a provider credential and cannot bypass the Router — the OpenShell
sandbox makes the gate mandatory, not advisory.

    """A direct TCP connect to the vendor must FAIL — only the Router is in the allowlist.

    OpenShell enforces at two layers, and a raw socket is the right probe for this one.
    A per-sandbox netns installs an nftables OUTPUT chain that accepts only proxy-bound,
    loopback, and established traffic and rejects the rest with ICMP port-unreachable — so
    a socket that bypasses the proxy is refused at connect time. The 403-on-CONNECT this
    example's `policy.yaml` describes is the *other* layer: it governs proxy-mediated
    requests, which a raw socket never becomes. Both statements are true; they are not
    alternatives.

    One caveat that does not change the assertion: nftables installation is best-effort,
    and without the `nft` binary the failure degrades from an immediate refusal to a
    timeout. `socket.timeout` is an `OSError` subclass, so this still reports blocked —
    just more slowly.
