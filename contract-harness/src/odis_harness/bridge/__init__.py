"""The ODIS Bridge — leg-2 (Router→vendor MCP) token-exchange.

The Router authenticates to each vendor MCP with a SHORT-LIVED, audience-scoped bearer
obtained by exchanging the agent's workload identity for a vendor-audience-scoped
downstream token (RFC 8693 token-exchange / RFC 7523 JWT-bearer; RFC 8707 audience
binding). The agent's inbound token is NOT passed through (MCP no-token-passthrough);
the leg-2 token is freshly minted/exchanged, distinct from both the caller's token and
the vendor→provider credential, hydrated at runtime and never persisted.

`exchange` holds the seam (`ExchangedToken`, `TokenExchanger`, `BridgeAuth`);
`fixtures` holds the in-process stand-in.
