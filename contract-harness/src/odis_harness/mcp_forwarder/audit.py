"""Audit emission helpers for the Router.

Three emitters: `audit_forward`, `audit_refused`, and `audit_discovery_failed`. Every
audit event the harness produces comes from this module.

The `odis.mcp.*` event types are written as literals rather than as an enum:
`contracts.audit_taxonomy` owns the registered vocabulary and `AuditSink` validates
every event against it, so a typo surfaces as an `EnvelopeValidationError` on emission.

Each helper constructs its event and hands it to the provided `AuditSink`, stamping the
Authority Grant's identity — `policy_digest`, `bundle_id`, `bundle_version` and
`trust_root_id` — so the trail names the grant actually in force. All four come from one
`Bundle` argument rather than being passed separately, so they cannot disagree.

`vendor_endpoint_id` (from `Family.vendor_mcp`) is recorded in the event's
`extra`. The vendor's URL is NOT recorded: audit records reference
the stable endpoint id from the bundle so URL changes don't break the trail.
