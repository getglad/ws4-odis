"""HTTP transport for the Router's MCP server.

HTTP only (Streamable HTTP per the MCP spec). No stdio: the Router is a network
chokepoint an agent is routed *through*, not a subprocess it launches.
Any standard MCP client (Inspector, Claude Code, Cursor) connects to the server's URL
with no special handling — unless `serve --inbound-key` configured a token verifier, in
which case the client must also present a bearer the Router accepts.

`build_asgi_app` constructs the Starlette app (testable / mountable);
`serve_http` runs it under uvicorn until shutdown.
