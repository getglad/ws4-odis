"""MCP protocol glue — exposes a Router as an MCP `Server`.

Isolates the `mcp` SDK dependency from the forward engine (`router.py` stays
SDK-free). `build_mcp_server(router)` wires the SDK's low-level `Server` with
`tools/list` (from the discovery cache) and `tools/call` (dispatch to
`Router.forward`).

`tools/call` is registered with `validate_input=False`: the Router's own
policy + action-limit pipeline is the authority and audits every call. Letting
the SDK reject on inputSchema first would bypass that audit trail.
