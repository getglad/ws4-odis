"""PolicyEvaluator — per-family Rego evaluation via real OPA.

ODIS terminology: this is the Router's policy engine (APF Phase 1 calls it the
RPV). The evaluator uses the low-level `opa_eval` primitive and operates on a
`Bundle`'s per-family Rego string.

The evaluator returns whatever `decision` string the Rego produces, and the Router
treats anything other than `allow` as a refusal. So a policy that answers
`require_review` — or any third branch — refuses, and is indistinguishable from a
`deny` at the Router and in the audit trail. Distinguishing them needs a decision
vocabulary the Router acts on rather than a two-way `allow`/not-`allow` test.
