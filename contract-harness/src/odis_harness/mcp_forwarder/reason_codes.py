"""The refusal vocabulary the Router and its MCP handler emit.

Every refusal the forward path can produce, in one place. `StrEnum` members are
strings, so an emitted audit event and an `McpRefusal.reason_code` carry the same
wire value they always have — the enum only stops a typo from inventing a tenth
reason that nothing downstream recognises.

`reason_code` is free-form in `odis.audit.event.v1` (`type: string, minLength: 1`):
ODIS registers no refusal vocabulary, so this set is the harness's own.
