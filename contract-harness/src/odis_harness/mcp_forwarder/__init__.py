"""odis-mcp-forwarder — Router building block (ODIS canonical).

The Router exposes an MCP server toward the agent (HTTP transport per the MCP
spec), evaluates each tools/call against the signed bundle's policy via the
policy engine + action-limit enforcement, and forwards approved calls to the
vendor MCP server resolved from the bundle's routing entry. Vendor MCP servers
hold their own credentials at their own deploy time; the Router never sees a
provider bearer.
