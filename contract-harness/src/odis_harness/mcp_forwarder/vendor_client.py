"""`McpClient` Protocol + `InMemoryMcpClient` test double.

The Router holds one `McpClient` per family (per the bundle's routing table)
and calls it during forward orchestration. The production implementation
wraps the official `mcp` Python SDK's client primitives over HTTP; this module
defines the Protocol the Router programs against and ships an in-memory test
double that exercises the same surface.

`VendorUnreachable` is the typed transport-failure error; the Router catches
it at the forward boundary and converts to `odis.mcp.forward_refused` with
`reason_code: vendor_unreachable`.
