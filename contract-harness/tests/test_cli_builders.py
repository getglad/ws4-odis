"""Tests for `cli.builders` — the leg-2 session establish boot phase (the DL-2 leg-2 boot phase).

`build_router_from_bundle` runs a named "establish leg-2 sessions" phase between
building the per-family vendor clients and populating discovery: every client that is
`SupportsSessionEstablish` is primed once, concurrently and resiliently (one family's
failure is logged + degraded, never fatal). `establish()` returns the audience it
established (or `None` when nothing was — e.g. `auth=None`); only a non-`None` return
emits `bridge.leg2.established`. These are hermetic — no OPA, no network: the
`PolicyEvaluator` is constructed but never invoked at build time.
