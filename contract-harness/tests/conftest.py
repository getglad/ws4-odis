"""Session-scoped fixtures + env bootstrap (per python-testing.md).

Imports of harness code are deliberately deferred into the fixtures and hooks that
need them. Collection must never abort: a module-level import here would put the whole
harness import graph (mcp, httpx, starlette, uvicorn) between pytest and a single
collected test, so one broken optional dependency would yield zero tests run instead
of a targeted skip.
